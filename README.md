This project contains a minimal particle simulation built with Matter.js.
Particles follow the mouse cursor and bounce off the browser window edges.

Each particle now has a simple state with an **energy** value that changes
based on proximity to the mouse. Energy affects the color of the particle and
the strength of the force pulling it toward the cursor.

Open `Psych/index.html` in a browser to see the simulation.
